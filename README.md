# Bayes to the Future: Predicting Heart Disease

## 🧪 Overview
This project uses a **Discrete Bayesian Network** to predict heart disease risk based on patient data from a cleaned version of `heart_disease.csv`. It performs data cleaning, min-max normalization, MLE training using `pgmpy`, and answers medical inference queries.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heart-disease-bayes.git
cd heart-disease-bayes

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the model
python bayes_heart_model.py
### ✅ STEP 5: Terminal Commands

```bash
# 1. Clone repo or create folder
mkdir heart_disease_prediction
cd heart_disease_prediction

# 2. Download dataset
wget -O heart_disease.csv https://bit.ly/3T1A7Rs

# 3. Create Python environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Create files
# Paste the above code into bayes_heart_model.py
# Paste README.md and requirements.txt too

# 5. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 6. Run the model
python bayes_heart_model.py
