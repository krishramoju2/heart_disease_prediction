# Bayes to the Future: Predicting Heart Disease

## 🧪 Overview
This project uses a **Discrete Bayesian Network** to predict heart disease risk based on patient data from a cleaned version of `heart_disease.csv`. It performs data cleaning, min-max normalization, MLE training using `pgmpy`, and answers medical inference queries.
